This is a basic ddos tool with no special things. 
Pls only use it for legal purposes!!!

I made a open source and a .exe from the ddos tool.
ItÂ´s basically the same, but the .exe will work a bit faster.
If you not sure what to download, download first the open source one for secure, because your Pc will say the .exe is a virus.
But if you want the .exe also you need deactivat the anti-virus from Windows to download it.

If you want to know if there is any virus, you can go on the website https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload to search for any viruses.

If there is any problem you can contact me on discord Caiser#4435
